### Description
The russet-crowned motmot (Momotus mexicanus) is a species of motmot native to north-western Mexico and central Guatemala.
It is a year-round resident of the tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests and scrubland. The russet-crowned motmot is the most understudied species of motmot in the family Momotidae.
"Russet" refers to the reddish-brown colour of the bird's head and originates from the Latin russus meaning red.[^1]
