# Western Sandpiper <span className='sci_name'>Calidris mauri</span>

## Overview

### Description
The western sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is a small shorebird. The genus name is from Ancient Greek kalidris or skalidris, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific mauri commemorates Italian botanist Ernesto Mauri (1791â€“1836).
This is one of the most abundant shorebird species in North America, with a population in the millions.[^1]
