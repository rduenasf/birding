# Common Wood-Pigeon <span className='sci_name'>Columba palumbus</span>

## Overview

### Description
The common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus), also known simply as the wood pigeon, is a large species in the dove and pigeon family (Columbidae), native to the western Palearctic. It belongs to the genus Columba, which includes closely related species such as the rock dove (Columba livia). It has a flexible diet, feeding mainly on plant material, including cereals, and is therefore considered an agricultural pest. Wood pigeons are extensively hunted over much of their range, but this does not appear to have a major impact on their population numbers.[^1]
