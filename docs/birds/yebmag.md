# Yellow-billed Magpie <span className='sci_name'>Pica nuttalli</span>

## Overview

### Description
The yellow-billed magpie (Pica nuttalli), also known as the California magpie, is a large corvid that inhabits California's Central Valley and the adjacent chaparral foothills and mountains. Apart from its having a yellow bill and a yellow streak around the eye, it is virtually identical to the black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia) found in much of the rest of North America. 
The scientific name commemorates the English naturalist Thomas Nuttall.[^1]
