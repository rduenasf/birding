# Spotted Flycatcher <span className='sci_name'>Muscicapa striata</span>

## Overview

### Description
The spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata) is a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family.  It breeds in most of Europe and in the Palearctic to Siberia, and is migratory, wintering in Africa and south western Asia. It is declining in parts of its range.
This is an undistinguished looking bird with long wings and tail. The adults have grey-brown upperparts and whitish underparts, with a streaked crown and breast, giving rise to the bird's common name. The legs are short and black, and the bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. Juveniles are browner than adults and have spots on the upperparts.[^1]
